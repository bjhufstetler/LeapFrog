  abstract={This paper contains the description of a traveling salesman problem library (TSPLIB) which is meant to provide researchers with a broad set of test problems from various sources and with various properties. For every problem a short description is given along with known lower and upper bounds. Several references to computational tests on some of the problems are given.
